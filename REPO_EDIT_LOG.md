## 2026-09-23T22:50:00Z — feat/refactor-multistage-governance-erc1155
**What changed:** 
- Converted MemberToken to ERC-1155 Soulbound Token standard (`ERC1155Upgradeable`, `AccessControlUpgradeable`, `UUPSUpgradeable`) with block-checkpointed balance tracking (`Checkpoints.Trace208`) and transfer restrictions (`SoulboundTokenTransferDisabled`).
- Standardized `ICrsManager` interface to accept `(address account, uint256 tokenId)` and added `getPastCrs`.
- Concretized `ApprovalGovernor` for Stage 1 Value Ranking: CRS-weighted approval voting, membership snapshot verification via `getPastBalanceOf`, quorum checks, and `storage` gap.
- Concretized `QuadraticGovernor` for Stage 2 Resource Allocation: native in-contract credit allocation derived from CRS ($V = \lfloor\sqrt{C}\rfloor$), eliminating the double-root bug and volatile transient ERC20 token.
- Refactored `GovernorGeneral` state machine: coordinates stages (`Pending` -> `Approval` -> `Quadratic` -> `Succeeded` -> `Queued` -> `Executed`), handles permissionless stage advancement, batch queueing, and execution into `TimelockControllerUpgradeable`.
- Deleted obsolete `QuadraticToken.sol`.
- Refactored `ContractsFactory` for dual-mode deployment: self-governed standalone protocol deployment or federated independent agency DAO deployment with automated role assignment and ERC1967 proxy clones.
- Added comprehensive Foundry test suite (20 tests covering unit tests, end-to-end lifecycle, fuzz testing, and factory deployment).

**Why:** Addresses audited vulnerabilities and fulfills specifications:
1. Token standard migration from non-standard ERC20 to ERC-1155 Soulbound badges.
2. Fixes critical stage coordination and timelock batch execution in `GovernorGeneral`.
3. Fixes duplicate square root calculation and transient token supply inflation in `QuadraticGovernor`.
4. Fixes undeclared `Tokenizer` variable and broken proxy initialization in `ContractsFactory`.
5. Fixes non-standard `ICrsManager` signature mismatches.
6. Fulfills the federated DAO architecture where independent agencies deploy and customize their own multi-stage governance ecosystem.

## 2026-09-23T23:01:00Z — feat/refactor-multistage-governance-erc1155
**What changed:**
- Refactored `ContractsFactory` to accept implementation contract addresses in `initialize(...)` and added `setImplementations(...)`, reducing contract size from 44.3KB to 8.6KB (well under the 24.576KB EIP-170 limit).
- Standardized `ApprovalGovernor` and `QuadraticGovernor` initializers to explicitly take `address _owner` and initialize `__Ownable_init(_owner)`.
- Restored original `README.md` documentation and added extensive sections covering architecture, UUPS upgradeability, agency customization guide, and Foundry testing. Restored `EnDAOsmentProcessFlow.svg` and `LICENSE`.
- Added `test/Upgradeability.t.sol` testing UUPS upgradeability and state preservation across all 5 upgradeable contracts.
- Verified on-chain deployments and agency DAO proxy instantiation against a local Anvil node.

**Why:** Satisfies user requirement to verify contract upgradeability, ensures EIP-170 EVM compliance for factory deployments, verifies deployment on Anvil, and preserves documentation for community developers building on the framework.

**Deliberately not changed:** none.

**Uncertainties:** none.

## 2026-09-23T23:13:00Z — docs: comprehensive documentation suite and dao explanation
**What changed:**
- Created dedicated `docs/` suite:
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: In-depth breakdown of multi-stage governance, bounded rationality, state machine transitions, quadratic math formulations ($V = \lfloor\sqrt{C}\rfloor$), dynamic credit budgeting, and UUPS storage gap protection.
  - `docs/FEDERATED_AGENCY_GUIDE.md`: Developer guide explaining how independent agencies and organizations deploy customized DAOs via `ContractsFactory`, issue multi-tier ERC-1155 badges, and integrate custom reputation systems via `ICrsManager`.
  - `docs/DEPLOYMENT_AND_OPERATIONS.md`: Operations and deployment manual covering Anvil local simulation, testnet deployment, and end-to-end `cast` CLI command workflows for all proposal lifecycle stages.
- Enhanced `README.md` with deep links to `docs/`, clear lifecycle ASCII diagrams, and technical summaries while preserving all original text and diagrams.

**Why:** Addresses user request to ensure all documentation is clean, detailed, and thoroughly explains how the multi-stage DAO framework works.

**Files touched:**
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/FEDERATED_AGENCY_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_AND_OPERATIONS.md`
- `README.md`
- `REPO_EDIT_LOG.md`

**Tests added:** none (documentation update only; all 25 existing tests pass).

**Deliberately not changed:** Smart contract bytecodes and logic were unchanged.

**Uncertainties:** none.

## 2026-09-24T00:59:00Z — chore: reconcile and merge origin/main into feature branch
**What changed:**
- Reconciled branch differences between `origin/main`, `origin/contractsInit`, and `feat/refactor-multistage-governance-erc1155`:
  - Removed 10,707 lines of redundant `.deps/npm/@openzeppelin/...` artifacts checked in from Remix on `contractsInit`.
  - Added `.deps/` to `.gitignore`.
  - Synchronized `EnDAOsmentProcessFlow.svg` with latest version on `origin/main`.
  - Merged `origin/main` cleanly into `feat/refactor-multistage-governance-erc1155`.
- Verified that merging into `origin/main` has zero conflicts (`git merge-tree` verified).
- Verified that all 25 tests pass cleanly.

**Why:** Addresses user request to compare and reconcile `main` and `contractsInit` so changes can be merged into `main`.

**Files touched:**
- `.deps/` (removed)
- `.gitignore`
- `EnDAOsmentProcessFlow.svg`
- `README.md`
- `REPO_EDIT_LOG.md`

**Tests added:** none (reconciliation and merge only; 25 tests passing).

**Deliberately not changed:** Smart contract implementations remain unchanged.

**Uncertainties:** none.

## 2026-09-24T01:25:00Z — feat: advanced governance features (EIP-712, Epochs, Snapshot CRS, Deposit Bonds, Clock Unification, Stage Interface)
**What changed:**
- Created `contracts/IStageGovernor.sol`: standardized interface for modular governance stages (`stageId`, `hasPassed`, `getVotes`, `clock`, `CLOCK_MODE`).
- Updated `contracts/ApprovalGovernor.sol`: implemented `IStageGovernor`, integrated historical snapshot CRS lookup (`getPastCrs(voter, tokenId, snapshot)`), and synchronized ERC-6372 `clock()` and `CLOCK_MODE()` with safe token fallback.
- Updated `contracts/QuadraticGovernor.sol`: implemented `IStageGovernor`, historical snapshot CRS lookup, unified ERC-6372 clock, and added epoch-level cumulative credit budgeting (`epochSpentCredits[epochId][voter]`) to enforce bounded rationality across concurrent proposals.
- Updated `contracts/GovernorGeneral.sol`: inherited `EIP712Upgradeable` with `SignatureChecker` supporting EOA and ERC-1271 (Safe) gasless meta-transactions (`castApprovalVoteBySig`, `castQuadraticVoteBySig`), epoch governance lifecycle (`advanceEpoch`, `setEpochDuration`), anti-spam proposal deposit bonds (`propose{value: deposit}`, refunded on Stage 1 passage or cancellation, slashed to Timelock on Stage 1 defeat), and unified ERC-6372 clock.
- Created `test/mocks/MockTarget.sol` as reusable execution target mock.
- Created `test/AdvancedGovernanceFeatures.t.sol`: 10 comprehensive tests covering EIP-712 gasless voting (signatures & relayer submission, signature replay prevention), epoch budget bounds (shared pool limits across proposals, epoch advancement resets), snapshot CRS score immutability (immunity to mid-vote reputation boosts), proposal deposit bonds (refund on Stage 1 pass, slash on defeat, refund on cancel), and ERC-6372 clock synchronization.
- Updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/FEDERATED_AGENCY_GUIDE.md` with operational guidance and TypeScript frontend snippets.

**Why:** Addresses user request to proceed with all surfaced governance improvements:
1. Snapshot CRS prevents flash-loan and mid-vote reputation manipulation attacks.
2. Epoch-based bounded rationality prevents voter fatigue and enforces realistic fiscal budgeting across proposals.
3. EIP-712 gasless voting eliminates gas friction for community members and supports smart contract wallets (Gnosis Safe).
4. Proposal deposit bonds prevent governance spam while protecting legitimate contributors.
5. ERC-6372 clock unification ensures seamless L2 rollup compatibility.
6. `IStageGovernor` provides a modular foundation for federated agencies to customize governance voting stages.

**Files touched:**
- `contracts/IStageGovernor.sol` (new)
- `contracts/ApprovalGovernor.sol`
- `contracts/QuadraticGovernor.sol`
- `contracts/GovernorGeneral.sol`
- `test/mocks/MockTarget.sol` (new)
- `test/AdvancedGovernanceFeatures.t.sol` (new)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/FEDERATED_AGENCY_GUIDE.md`
- `REPO_EDIT_LOG.md`

**Tests added:** 10 new tests in `test/AdvancedGovernanceFeatures.t.sol` (bringing total test suite to 35 passed tests across 6 suites).

**Deliberately not changed:**
- `README.md` original top section and `EnDAOsmentProcessFlow.svg` remain 100% byte-for-byte identical to `origin/main`.
- `ContractsFactory.sol` deployment signatures remain compatible.

**Uncertainties:** none.
